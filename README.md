# How to download & install

- [Download the newest binaries from the releases page here.](https://github.com/pine64/pine64_updater/releases)
- Works for original Pinecil V1 sold by Pine64 before August 2022 and uses DFU for firmware.
- Does not work for any authentic Pine64 Pinecils sold after Aug. 1, 2022 because Pine64 switched to a new MCU chip.
- Newer Pinecil V2 models require a different flasher because of the new MCU chip (BL706 with BLE bluetooth). Pinecil V2 and other [Bouffalo flashers are here](https://github.com/pine64/blisp).
- Pinecil Wiki page has many details on V1/V2 with links to the [Live Community Chat channels](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinecil#Live_Community_Chat). Firmware instructions are also on Pinecil Wiki.
